This code creates a simple notepad application with a text widget where the user can enter text, and a menu bar with 'File' option, where you can select option to open or save a file. 'open_file' and 'save_file' functions uses filedialog method from tkinter to open and save a file respectively.
It also set the title to "Notepad" on the window and use the mainloop() function to start the application and wait for the user's interaction.

It's a good start but keep in mind that this example is quite basic and you might want to add other features to the application like ability to edit or delete text, or ability to use different font styles.
